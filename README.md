Firefox extension that transforms the New Tab into a minimalist, auto-saving text editor.

## TODO

- [ ] Integrate a new [options](https://github.com/semanticdata/firefox-chatgpt-in-sidebar/blob/main/options/options.js) menu, or toggle. Could be used to store bg-color, txt-color, etc. This in theory allows the user to customize the editor.

## Acknowledgments

This extension is based on [Tab Notes](https://github.com/nsht/tab_notes) which hasn't received an update in 4 years.
