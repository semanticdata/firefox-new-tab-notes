## Overview

Firefox extension that transforms the New Tab into a minimalist, auto-saving text editor.

## Features

- Integrates Firefox Sync. Access your notes across browser instances.
- Dark/Light themes and toggle.
- Autosaves your content after every keystroke.
- Uses [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) for styling.
- Uses [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) as default font.

## TODO

- [x] Add [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) for basic styling.
- [x] Integrate w/ Firefox Sync. Notes content is preserved between machines.
- [x] Add [Fira Code](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code) as font-family for the editor.
- [x] Add light and dark themes incl. toggle.
- [ ] Integrate a new [options](https://github.com/semanticdata/firefox-chatgpt-in-sidebar/blob/main/options/options.js) menu, or toggle.
  - Could be used to store bg-color, txt-color, etc. This in theory allows the user to customize the editor.
